biofuels,tbfu20,"current energy systems need a vast transformation to meet the key demands of the 21st century: reduced environmental impact, economic viability and efficiency. an essential part of this energy revolution is bioenergy.
the movement towards widespread implementation of first generation biofuels is still in its infancy, requiring continued evaluation and improvement to be fully realised. problems with current bioenergy strategies, for example competition over land use for food crops, do not yet have satisfactory solutions. the second generation of biofuels, based around cellulosic ethanol, are now in development and are opening up new possibilities for future energy generation. recent advances in genetics have pioneered research into designer fuels and sources such as algae have been revealed as untapped bioenergy resources.
as global energy requirements change and grow, it is crucial that all aspects of the bioenergy production process are streamlined and improved, from the design of more efficient biorefineries to research into biohydrogen as an energy carrier. current energy infrastructures need to be adapted and changed to fulfil the promises of biomass for power generation.
biofuels provides a forum for all stakeholders in the bioenergy sector, featuring review articles, original research, commentaries, news, research and development spotlights, interviews with key opinion leaders and much more, with a view to establishing an international community of bioenergy communication.
as biofuel research continues at an unprecedented rate, the development of new feedstocks and improvements in bioenergy production processes provide the key to the transformation of biomass into a global energy resource. with the twin threats of climate change and depleted fossil fuel reserves looming, it is vitally important that research communities are mobilized to fully realize the potential of bioenergy. biofuels accepts the following types of article: original articles.
articles published in biofuels cover key areas in the development of bioenergy, such as:
• sustainable production of annual, perennial and wood feedstocks from agriculture
• creation of new biomass feedstocks in laboratories
• biochemical conversion techniques
• fermentation, anaerobic digestion and enzyme development
• thermochemical conversion techniques
• biocatalyst development, gasification and pyrolysis plants
• bioenergy systems and plant engineering
• conversion of biomass into heat, electricity and biohydrogen
• storage and transportation of biomass during manufacture
• implementation, improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact of first generation biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel
• new bioenergy sources: algae, genetically engineered fuels, and biochemical carbon dioxide conversion
• policy, management and communication to establish a global bioenergy market

engineering studies,test20,"engineering studies is an interdisciplinary, international journal devoted to the scholarly study of engineers and engineering. its mission is threefold:
  1. to advance critical analysis in historical, social, cultural, political, philosophical, rhetorical, and organizational studies of engineers and engineering;
2. to help build and serve diverse communities of researchers interested in engineering studies;
3. to link scholarly work in engineering studies with broader discussions and debates about engineering education, research, practice, policy, and representation.

the editors of engineering studies are interested in papers that consider the following questions:
• how does this paper enhance critical understanding of engineers or engineering?
• what are the relationships among the technical and nontechnical dimensions of engineering practices, and how do these relationships change over time and from place to place?

researchers in technical communication, technical work, and engineering education research should take special note of the journal's emphasis on critical analysis. it does not publish manuscripts that seek only to improve the effectiveness of engineering education and engineering work in existing terms.
engineering studies publishes a variety of article types. please see the instructions for authors for more information.
engineering studies is published three times yearly by routledge, an imprint of the taylor and francis group, beginning in 2009.
 

vision statement
the field of engineering studies is a diverse, interdisciplinary arena of scholarly research built around the question: what are the relationships among the technical and the nontechnical dimensions of engineering practices, and how do these relationships change over time and from place to place? addressing and responding to this question can sometimes involve researchers as critical participants in the practices they study, including, for example, engineering formation, engineering work, engineering design, equity in engineering (gender, racial, ethnic, class, geopolitical), and engineering service to society.

engineering studies juxtaposes contributions from distinct disciplinary and analytical perspectives to encourage authors and readers to look beyond familiar theoretical, topical, temporal, and geographical boundaries for insight and guidance. the diversity in the editorial staff and board is designed to map the diversity in the field and support its persistence. while prospective authors are invited to reflect on and anticipate how their work might prove helpful to others elsewhere, both within the academy and beyond, they can also feel comfortable imagining familiar audiences and producing familiar modes of analysis and interpretation. the heterogeneity of perspectives in engineering studies is its lifeblood, and the goal is high quality scholarship in every case.

european journal of engineering education,ceee20,"european journal of engineering education is a forum for scholarly dialogue to further engineering education.
the journal embraces multiple perspectives to examine relevant conditions, developments, approaches, methods and experiences relevant for the education of engineers.
it is a european journal with global readership and authorship. while the european context is emphasised, papers presenting wider international or intercultural dimensions, of interest to our readers, could also be considered for publication.
the journal focuses on higher engineering education. it could also consider related contexts of general interest to the engineering education community, such as prior education.

european journal of engineering education invites relevant contributions that combine scholarliness with usefulness for improving engineering education.
usefulness implies that papers should be useful to readers outside the context where the work was made. usefulness can take many forms, to readers who can be educators, researchers, specialists, leaders, or other stakeholders of engineering education.
scholarliness refers to the significance and novelty of the contribution, consistency and soundness of the research approach, connection to relevant literature, coherence and readability of the paper, as well as credibility and quality of the ideas and insights generated.

european journal of engineering education is the official journal of sefi, the european society for engineering education (société européenne pour la formation des ingénieurs). its members are higher education institutions, individuals, associations and companies who share the common goal of improving the engineering education and strengthening the image of the engineering profession.

european journal of environmental and civil engineering,tece20,"the european research area has now become a reality. the prime objective of the ejece is to fully document advances in international scientific and technical research in the fields of sustainable construction and soil engineering. in particular regard to the latter, the mechanical behavior of natural media (soils and rocks) in their environment and the mitigation of soil-related risks are now not only major societal challenges, but they are also the source of scientific and technical developments that could be extremely beneficial.
areas covered by the ejece include rheology of geomaterials (cement, soils, rocks), natural media (muds, snow, ice, etc.) and granular materials, soil-fluid-structure interactions and their coupling with temperature, chemistry (degradation, etc.) and time (durability, ageing, etc.), computation and design of structures and engineering works. the new experimental facilities and measurement tools (metrology and sensors in laboratories and in the field, etc.) and the characterizing of displacement fields and of micro-meso-structures of materials (scanner, tomodensitometer, etc.) give rise to major innovations which concern thus primarily the ejece. finally the numerical methods (finite differences, finite elements, discrete elements, particulate methods, etc), which constitute obviously the bases of the modelling and of the computation of structures and engineering works, fall completely in the interest area of the journal.
manuscripts should present original studies including scientific advances. case studies could be considered only if they are related to a clear scientific or technical innovation.

manuscript genres

ejis categorizes papers according to the genre of research. more detail about these genres can be found in earlier ejis editorials (te'eni et al., 2015; rowe, 2012; rowe, 2014).

1. literature review
a literature review ‘synthesizes past knowledge on a topic or domain of interest, identifies important biases and knowledge gaps in the literature, and proposes corresponding future research directions’ (rowe, 2014, p. 243). researchers need to have a good conceptual framework or theory that they will use as an analytical lens to study a set of carefully selected papers (rowe, 2014).

2. theory development
ejis, as a european journal, accepts pure theory papers. we need theory to guide our reflections and endeavours. a good theory paper rests on arguments that build on the literature. however, unlike the first genre, these articles do not need to have a comprehensive literature review. the act of being reflexively critical is essential and is a distinguishing feature of this genre (te'eni et al., 2015).

3. empirical research
this genre includes papers that provide empirical data. however, these papers must also provide a theoretical contribution. apart from ‘ethnographies and narratives’ which are singled out at ejis as a separate genre, all other genres based on an analysis of empirical data fall under the ‘empirical research’ category. this category includes all types of empirical research strategies such as qualitative, quantitative and design science research (te'eni et al., 2015).

4. ethnographies and narratives
of the many streams of empirical research, we distinguish ethnographies and narratives (rowe, 2012). this genre responds to the need to better understand what people really do, how intentions develop, and how people take stances or make compromises. using ethnographic fieldwork, the researcher not only gains an in-depth understanding of the actors’ viewpoints. but also of the broad context within which they act (te'eni et al., 2015).

5. research essay
research essays usually relate to research methods, research practice or research philosophy.

6. issues and opinions
an ‘issues and opinions’ paper generally addresses an institutional problem or a disciplinary challenge or opportunity. this genre involves the articulation of a well-developed position statement concerning emerging, paradoxical, or controversial research issues.

7. response
this genre is simply a response to a paper previously published in ejis, of any genre. for example, an empirical response paper might replicate a previous study with a different method but come up with contradictory findings.

intelligent buildings international,tibi20,"intelligent buildings and cities can be defined by the following four pillars of knowledge:
people: health and well-being of individuals and communities.
balance between low and high technologies: discrete use of smart enabling technologies but with consideration to the use of natural passive systems.
sustainability: the design and management for net zero energy consumption, water saving, minimum waste and pollution.
connection with nature: research and applications of biomimetics and biophilia have shown that nature is not only vital for health and well-being but offers ways of being sustainable in the minimum use of energy and materials.
buildings and cities are planned, designed and managed for the long term by a multidisciplinary supply and demand chain of stakeholders so collaboration and effective leadership are essential. setting long term visions and effective connectivity processes based on improving social value are key. this is true for designing new or regenerating old buildings and cities.
submissions are welcomed on topics related to:
intelligent buildings and cities: visions and strategies
innovation and technology
transdisciplinary approach using knowledge from across sectors
people: health and wellbeing
user sensory design
social value economics
design and management
biomimetics and biophilia
designing and managing for sustainability
assessing and rating measures for sustainability, health and wellbeing
these are broad headings only and you may propose other topics. your approach may be from a review or your own research, a case study, an opinion essay, or simply a technical note. the journal wants to encompass how we deal with the disruption arising from change, new ways of thinking, strategic planning with an emphasis on value rather than just capital short-term costs. the journal welcomes contributions from a wide variety of disciplines, including medicine, psychology, sociology, ecology, ergonomics, as well as architecture, engineering and project management.
one can also learn a lot from cross sector approaches. the car, aerospace and fashion worlds for example share a common knowledge on design. the journal is open to ideas and collective thinking not bound by tradition but remembering that lessons from history as well as the present lead us into the future.
the emphasis is on the big picture and joining up the various fields of knowledge to make an effective contribution to advancing the field of intelligent buildings and cities. in depth case study evidence is welcome too.

peer-review

all manuscript submissions are subject to initial evaluation by the editors.  it is rare for an exceptional manuscript to be accepted at this stage. manuscripts may be rejected at this stage due to one of the following reasons: insufficient originality, serious scientific flaws, poor grammar or english language, or if the manuscript is out of scope.  those that meet the minimum criteria are passed on to regular peer review.

the editorial board of ijms will strive to keep the time of each-round review within two to six months. based on the review results from referees, the editors’ decision will be acceptance, rejection, or further revision. the authors will have a chance to make two-round revisions. beyond that, an editorial decision will normally be made to accept or reject the article. the editors’ decision will be emailed to the authors with recommendations made by the referees. 


guest editors and reviewers

proposals for special issues in cutting-edge areas of modelling and simulation are invited, and a one-page plan should be sent to the editor-in-chief.

if you are not currently a referee for ijms but would like to be considered as a referee, please contact the editor-in-chief. you will have an opportunity to evaluate the latest work in your research area at an early stage, and to make a contribution to the overall integrity of scientific research.

international journal of occupational safety and ergonomics,tose20,"the international journal of occupational safety and ergonomics (jose) is a refereed interdisciplinary quarterly journal. published since 1995, its paramount aim has always been to create a platform for presenting results of research in ergonomics and workplace health promotion relevant for the diverse, yet increasingly globalizing world. whereas social and economic problems and researchers' modus operandi in various countries and climates are similar, legislation, safety and management culture are not. we are interested in showing how the same problems are studied and solved in different parts of the world and how the same methods can produce different results. comparing those problems and views, in their diversity, helps perceive them in a wider context, in a global perspective.
our mission involves both looking at each problem in its cultural, social and economic contexts and approaching it from the broad perspective of various fields. greater awareness follows, with authors able to connect with fellow researchers in other fields, who work on the same problems.
even though the principal objective of jose is to publish research, we do not perceive this aim as limited to significant original contributions to knowledge; we are also interested in contributions that prove well-known solutions can be used in practice. everything that can make work easier and workplace health better is worthy of dissemination.
subjects covered by this journal include: accidents, acoustical engineering, aerosol science, automation, biological hazards, biomechanics, chemical hazards, computer modelling, environmental engineering, ergonomics, ergonomics and human factors, health management, industrial design, occupational and environmental mechanical hazards, medicine, microclimate, physiology, multidisciplinary psychology, protective equipment, risk assessment, safety of machinery, sociology and social policy, testing, health and safety at work and work-design – ergonomics.

international journal of systems science,tsys20,"international journal of systems science (ijss) is a world leading journal dedicated to publishing high quality, rigorously reviewed, original papers that contribute to the methodology and practice in emerging systems engineering themes of intelligence, autonomy and complexity.
  modern systems are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated in their demand for performance, reliability and increasing autonomy. historically, highly analytic and numeric-based methods have sufficed, frequently simplifying the problem to allow analytical tractability. many manufactured and natural systems (biological, ecological and socio-economic) cannot be adequately represented or analyzed without requiring multiple interacting and interconnected frameworks and a common information-processing framework. a wide range of new theories, methodologies and techniques are required to ‘enable’ such systems, and thus engineering and integration to deal with these demands.

ijss therefore encourages original submissions in these areas, with special focus on papers that are strongly novel as well as not being overly applied. proposals for special issues in cutting-edge areas of systems science are encouraged, and should be discussed with the editor-in-chief.
  papers that cover those topics related to operations management and logistics will not be accepted for publication in ijss. instead they should be submitted directly to sister journal international journal of systems science: operations and logistics.

the joeh publishes studies across a range of investigation types, including laboratory investigations, field studies, simulations, and secondary data analyses to help understand occupational and environmental hygiene. stressors relating to adverse health outcomes are the main focus of the joeh , including chemical, biological, radiation, noise, ergonomics, and psychosocial hazards, including how work-life organization affects these exposures.

relevant topics include:
- method development to assess exposures, including sensor technology, analytical methods, and field sampling equipment
- exposure assessments and models that are generalizable across an identified population(s)
- risk assessments and models relating health outcomes to exposures
- exposure determinants that identify significant contributions to exposures
- control strategies (design, performance) to minimize exposures and disease risks
- personal protective equipment assessments and strategies
- emergency preparedness and response
- exposures and risks of special populations that are underrepresented in the literature
- the changing workforce and environment

knowledge management research and practice,tkmr20,"knowledge management is a term that has worked its way into the mainstream of both academic and business arenas since it was first coined in the 1980s. interest has increased rapidly during the last decade and shows no signs of abating. the current state of the knowledge management field is that it encompasses four overlapping areas:

managing knowledge (creating/acquiring, sharing, retaining, storing, using, updating, retiring)
organisational learning
intellectual capital
knowledge economics

within (and across) these, knowledge management has to address issues relating to technology, people, culture and systems.

perhaps as a consequence of this diversity, the knowledge management literature is at present fragmented. many of the most influential articles on knowledge management appear in journals in fields as diverse as information systems, general management, strategy, organisational sociology or human resources. the literature also often, somewhat misleadingly, presents the subject as split. current examples of these ""splits"", which should rather be debates, include those between the ""codification"" and ""collaboration"" schools of thought, and between ""western"" (meaning north american) and ""eastern"" (meaning japanese) approaches. the intention for this journal is not only to accommodate these and other perspectives, but also to seek common ground between them.

overall aims and content

to provide an outlet for high-quality, peer-reviewed articles on all aspects of managing knowledge. this will include not just those focused on the organisational level, but all levels from that of the individual to that of the nation or profession. this will include both theoretical and practical aspects, and especially the relationship between the two. there will be a particular emphasis on cross-disciplinary approaches, and on the mixing of ""hard"" (e.g. technological) and ""soft"" (e.g. cultural or motivational) issues. rigorous contributions from both academics and practitioners are welcomed.

articles may be empirical research papers, theoretical papers, conceptual papers, case studies or surveys.

kmrp will fill the need for a journal specifically concentrating on knowledge management that maintains the highest standards of rigour, and publishes articles that reflect greater multidisciplinary work and/or conceptual integration than those currently published in existing outlets.

a cross-disciplinary focus will also enable articles in the journal to address other important tensions in the field of knowledge management, such as those between:

strategy and operations
people and technology
short-term and long-term needs
the organisation and the individual

qmj publishes only original work, not work previously published or under review by another publication. types of articles suitable for publication in qmj include the following:
  empirical articles that provide objective evidence concerning actual quality management practice and its effectiveness. these articles should be written in a manner that emphasizes the managerial implications of the research results and the rationale for the study. articles should demonstrate use of accepted rigorous methods for empirical research.
 research case studies that consider either a single application or a small number of cases. these articles should include a structured approach for comparison of the cases and should lead to a set of propositions. either quantitative or qualitative comparison is appropriate. for a helpful description of research case studies, see k. m. eisenhardt’s 1989 article, “building theories from case study research,” in academy of management review (volume 14, no. 4, pages 532-550). 
management theory articles that present significant new insight and demonstrated practice. these articles should include testable propositions and should offer a foundation for future empirical research. 
review articles that create links to the existing academic literature and aid in the development of an identifiable quality management academic literature. such articles should represent a synthesis of existing literature and should demonstrate an understanding of quality management theory and practice.

theoretical issues in ergonomics science,ttie20,"theoretical issues in ergonomics science (ties) aims to advance the science and philosophy of human factors and ergonomics (hfe).  the journal promotes a broad array of theoretical issues, methodology, and philosophical dialogues about human interactions within simple and complex systems, and is a highly respected forum for interdisciplinary discussion within this field, cutting across the human-centered design, practice, engineering, technology, and management of human-compatible systems in the broadest sense. this includes data-driven applied and experimental work as well as work derived from the practice of hfe with the caveat that the work has implications to, or addresses in some manner, theoretical issues in ergonomics science.
  the journal seeks to explore the frontiers of ever expanding hfe discipline by focusing on hfe contributions to contemporary society in the context of human interactions with technology, engineering, economics and business, as well as consideration of safety and security, human ecology, sustainability, service systems, urbanization, communication, education, and social and government policies. ties also promotes a large scale system-of-system perspective of hfe, and discusses its implications for the development of the human-centered global society.

the journal is proactive in its mission to develop a unique hfe discipline, and seeks to define and promote theories of hfe as distinct and inherently valuable for the global knowledge community, including human factors scientists and safety engineers, ergonomists, industrial designers, industrial engineers, systems engineers, design engineers, cognitive and organizational psychologists, health care professionals, business analysts, and human-computer interaction and user experience specialists and practioners.

theoretical issues in ergonomics science emphasizes new knowledge, publishing original, high-quality, peer-reviewed papers as well as commissioned reviews and peer-reviewed commentaries. topics include both qualitative and quantitative methodological frameworks and hfe theories. the journal presents papers that discuss principles of the investigative process in research, social and historical issues, and science of science perspectives on hfe. papers that examine the discipline itself, including bibliographical analyses of classic papers, are also published.

unlike other hfe journals that deal primarily with applications, theoretical issues in ergonomics science focuses on theoretical aspects of the hfe discipline, such as causality and behaviour in a complex human-technology-environment systems. above all, the journal provides a vehicle for the dissemination of research on the underpinning scientific foundation of the discipline of hfe that no other publication covers. it creates the opportunity to consider the newest approaches of associated domains and to implant them in human-centered and human-compatible system design. authors are encouraged to discuss extensive and coherent theories that stimulate future empirical and modelling research within the hfe discipline.

all submissions are subject to initial appraisal by the co-editors, and if found suitable for further consideration, will enter peer review performed by independent, anonymous, expert referees.  all peer review is double blind. manuscripts for consideration are to be submitted using the ties scholarone site.
